# System Settings - Anganwadi Centers Update Summary

## ✅ Problem Resolved

**Issue**: System Settings page was showing only one Anganwadi center (Akkarakkunnu) instead of both centers, and user requested to remove the "Add Center" button.

**Solution**: Updated the System Settings implementation to:
1. Display both Anganwadi centers dynamically from database
2. Removed the "Add Center" button as requested
3. Added proper data loading from backend API
4. Created both centers in database with correct details

## 🏢 Current Anganwadi Centers Configuration

### Database Records Created:
1. **Akkarakkunnu Anganwadi**
   - Code: AWC09001
   - Ward: 9 (Elikkulam Panchayat)
   - Assigned Worker: Mohanakumari
   - Status: Active
   - Contact: 9876543210

2. **Veliyanoor Anganwadi**
   - Code: AWC09002
   - Ward: 9 (Elikkulam Panchayat)
   - Assigned Worker: Susheela
   - Status: Active
   - Contact: 9876543211

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### Frontend Updates (`SystemSettings.jsx`):
- **Removed "Add Center" button** from the interface
- **Dynamic data loading**: Updated `loadSettings()` to fetch centers from API
- **Improved table display**: Added Panchayat column and better formatting
- **Fallback data**: Provided fallback data structure for both centers
- **Enhanced UI**: Added proper status indicators and action buttons

### Backend Database:
- **Created Anganwadi centers** in MongoDB with complete information
- **Added AWW users** (Mohanakumari & Susheela) and assigned to centers
- **Proper relationships**: Linked workers to their respective centers

### API Integration:
- **Centers API**: Uses `/api/admin/settings/centers` endpoint
- **Data formatting**: Maps database objects to display format
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback when API fails

## 🎯 Current Display in System Settings

The Anganwadi Centers section now shows:

| Center Name | Ward | Panchayat | AWW Assigned | Status | Actions |

| Akkarakkunnu Anganwadi | Ward 9 | Elikkulam | Mohanakumari | Active | Edit, Map |
